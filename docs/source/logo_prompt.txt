Create a simple logo for a library called "AF Analysis".
This library is a python library designed to facilitate
analysis of Alphafold2 results.

The logo should be simple and modern, and should include
the name of the library ("AF Analysis") as well as an
icon or symbol that represents the library's focus on
structural bioinformatics prediction. 

The logo should be suitable for use on the library's website,
documentation, and other promotional materials.

As the library is developed in Paris Cit√© university, it
should show the Eiffel tower surrounded by viruses and
enzymes as well as differents graphics (scatterplot,
lineplot and matrix). The logo should have Blue color
as dominant color, and the background should be white.
The logo should be square or round with a "Art nouveau"
/ "Tiffany" style from 1920-1930.
