	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {While the vast majority of well-structured single protein chains can now be predicted to high accuracy due to the recent AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] >= 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ >= 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ >= 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ >= 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively. For homomeric inter-faces we successfully predict the interface in 72\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions in 36\% of cases, an improvement of +8 and +7 percentage points respectively.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We demonstrate that by stochastically perturbing the neural network by enabling dropout at inference combined with massive sampling, it is possible to improve the quality of the generated models. We generated ∼6000 models per target compared with 25 default for AlphaFold-Multimer, with v1 and v2 multimer network models, with and without templates, and increased the number of recycles within the network. The method was benchmarked in CASP15, and compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v2 it improved the average DockQ from 0.41 to 0.55 using identical input and was ranked at the very top in the protein assembly category when compared with all other groups participating in CASP15. The simplicity of the method should facilitate the adaptation by the field, and the method should be useful for anyone interested in modeling multimeric structures, alternate conformations, or flexible structures.AFsample is available online at http://wallnerlab.org/AFsample.}",

Methods like AlphaFold-Multimer and FoldDock can accurately model dimers. However, how well these methods fare on larger complexes is still unclear. Further, evaluation methods of the quality of multimeric complexes are not well established.We analysed the performance of AlphaFold-Multimer on a homology-reduced dataset of homo- and heteromeric protein complexes. We highlight the differences between the pairwise and multi-interface evaluation of chains within a multimer. We describe why certain complexes perform well on one metric (e.g. TM-score) but poorly on another (e.g. DockQ). We propose a new score, Predicted DockQ version 2 (pDockQ2), to estimate the quality of each interface in a multimer. Finally, we modelled protein complexes (from CORUM) and identified two highly confident structures that do not have sequence homology to any existing structures.All scripts, models, and data used to perform the analysis in this study are freely available at https://gitlab.com/ElofssonLab/afm-benchmark.}",

Using AI to predict the structure of macromolecular complexes, is gaining attention for modelling known interactions and evaluating the likelihood of proteins forming multimers or interacting with other proteins or nucleic acids. There is a growing need for tools to efficiently evaluate these predicted models. We introduce new tools that use AlphaFold3’s “predicted local-distance difference test” (pLDDT), “predicted aligned error” (PAE), and “predicted distance error” (PDE) matrices in a graph-based community clustering approach to label sequence motifs involved in binary interactions. The resulting “interaction image” is processed through a multidimensional image algorithm to cluster interacting sequence motifs in three-dimensional binary interfaces. This method allows us to present the interaction information between multiple proteins and nucleic acids back to two-dimensional space using chord diagrams. These “AlphaBridge” diagrams summarise predicted interfaces and intermolecular interactions, including prediction confidence and sequence conservation scores. They are valuable for efficient screening of predictions, ranking, and scoring the confidence of predicted interactions, prior to more detailed (and resource intensive) analysis.},
